Diving headfirst into the world of Computer Science as a 4th-year undergraduate in India, my journey is fueled by a childhood passion for programming, robotics, and electronics. I am a tech enthusiast with an unquenchable thirst for innovation, always on the hunt for the next big thing to learn and conquer. When I am not breaking new ground in code, you will find me devouring books, binge-watching movies, or bringing robots to life.
<br/> <br/>
I have delved into various aspects of computer science. From learning different programming languages to exploring algorithms and data structures, my academic journey has been a mix of theory and hands-on experience. I have taken on projects and coursework that allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world problems, honing my practical skills along the way.
