I'm currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student in India, and my passion for
Computer Science has been with me since my childhood. Growing up, I was always
fascinated by computers - understanding how they work and the potential they have
when we program them to improve our lives.
<br />
<br />
My childhood interests in programming, robotics, and electronics have led me to pursue
my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering. I was always that guy who wanted to
use his skills to make the world a better place for the socieT.
